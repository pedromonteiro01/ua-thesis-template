\section{Sources and Origins of the Dataset}
Constructing a dataset that covers all possible scenarios presents a significant challenge. However, it is feasible to create a comprehensive dataset by including images that represent factors that complicate detection, such as low lighting conditions and poor image resolution. 

The comprehensive exploration and analysis of various online datasets, like COCO \cite{rfc16} and CAVIAR \cite{rfc30}, played a key role in the development of an advanced and realistic dataset, aiming to mirror real-life scenarios, thereby enhancing its applicability in practical contexts. To this end, the dataset integrates images derived from a mock attack scenario \cite{rfc45}, simulating real-world environments like corridors and an entrance area in a university setting. These images, captured from three surveillance cameras, showcase individuals wielding weapons and other scenarios.

The cameras, strategically placed in two different corridors and one entrance, provide a variety of angles and positions, resulting in a rich and diverse visual dataset. Camera 1, in a corridor, recorded 607 frames amidst uniform lighting and obstructions like doors, Figure \ref{fig:cam1}. Camera 7, also in a corridor, gathered 3511 frames, with more complex environments including fire extinguishers. Camera 5, at the entrance, Figure \ref{fig:cam5}, added 1031 frames, distinguished by irregular lighting and obstacles like a black carpet. Annotated at 2 frames per second, these images from different perspectives provide a diverse and realistic depiction of the simulated scenarios.

Additionally, the dataset incorporates a selection of more general images of exposed weapons from the DaSCI collection \cite{rfc29}. This inclusion broadens the scope of the dataset, providing a more comprehensive view of weapon imagery. It also includes images that diverge from the theme of weapons and knives, featuring everyday objects such as wallets or bicycles.

In the process of creating this dataset, it was necessary to convert annotations from .xml files to .txt format to ensure compatibility with the YOLOv5 format.

In total, the dataset comprises 11020 images. A strategic division of these images allocates 80\% for training purposes. This portion is crucial for the development and refinement of the object detection model, allowing for extensive learning and adaptation based on a wide array of visual inputs. The remaining 20\% of the images are used for testing. 

Table \ref{datasets-table} presents a dataset summary, listing the source, number of images, resolution, format, and a brief description.
