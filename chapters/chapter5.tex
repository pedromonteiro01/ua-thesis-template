\section{Performance Evaluation}
\subsection{Results of the YOLO Model Analysis}
The performance evaluation of the object detection model was conducted using a computer equipped with an NVIDIA 
Quadro RTX 8000 GPU. This GPU, renowned for its high-performance capabilities in professional visualization and 
computational tasks, features 48GB of GDDR6 memory and supports CUDA 12.0. With a power usage capacity of 250W, 
the Quadro RTX 8000 is designed to handle demanding workloads, making it ideal for deep learning applications.

Several configurations were tested during the evaluation phase, including varying the number of epochs, batch sizes, 
and image sizes. The goal was to determine the optimal settings that would maximize the model's performance.
