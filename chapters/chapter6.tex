\section{Summary}
\section{Conclusions}
\section{Future Work}
The current implementation of this surveillance system provides a robust platform for monitoring through multiple 
camera feeds. However, to enhance its utility and performance, several improvements are proposed for future iterations.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implementation of Auto-Scaling Mechanisms: allow the system to 
    dynamically adjust its resources based on workload demands. This will involve integrating monitoring tools 
    and automated scaling policies.
    Additionally, exploring container orchestration platforms 
    like Kubernetes will be essential for managing resource allocation and scaling efficiently.
    \item Upgrading System Hardware: the addition of real-time object detection across multiple feeds needs a 
    corresponding upgrade in system hardware. As the number of cameras and the computational load increase, there is 
    a substantial impact on system performance. To mitigate this, an enhancement in both CPU and GPU capabilities will 
    be required. This upgrade will ensure that the system can handle the increased processing demands without degradation 
    in performance;
    \item Exploration of Advanced Object Detection Models: the implementation of newer versions of the YOLO 
    algorithm should be explored. These versions can offer improvements in detection accuracy.
\end{itemize}
