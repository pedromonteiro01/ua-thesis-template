The main actor of the system is the police officer, who is responsible for monitoring and managing the system's 
surveillance capabilities

Users have the ability to view live camera feeds, which provides real-time surveillance. The system must ensure that 
all cameras are operational and accessible. Users can select specific cameras to focus on, allowing for detailed 
monitoring of particular areas.

The upload video functionality allows a user to upload video content to the system. Once a video is uploaded, the 
system automatically processes it to detect any weapons shown in the images. The 
user must be authenticated and authorized to upload videos. After the video is processed, the 
results are stored in the system's database.

After videos have been processed, users can download these videos. This function is essential for users who need to 
keep offline records or further analyze video content. The system handles the retrieval and download of these videos, 
ensuring that users can access them conveniently and securely.

Check detection history use case allows users to review and audit the detection activities that have occurred. 
Users with the appropriate permissions can access detailed 
logs that document the specifics of detected threats, and when they were detected, providing a 
comprehensive audit trail.
%At the initial stage, users are presented with a list of all cameras that are registered under their account. 

%This list not only displays each camera but also includes information such as the camera's location and current operational
%status. Users can conveniently view real-time video streams from these cameras through the application's interface.

%Upon viewing the list, users can select any camera to access a more detailed monitoring view. This action 
%redirects to a specific page where the video feed from the chosen camera is displayed. This page works 
%as the hub for real-time video analysis. While monitoring the video feed, the application actively scans the stream 
%for the presence of weapons. If the detection model identifies a weapon within the video, the system generates an alert.

%In addition the application supports the upload of pre-recorded videos. Users can upload video files to the platform, which 
%are then analyzed by the same detection algorithms used for live streaming.

%After uploading a video for analysis, the system processes and annotates the footage with bounding boxes to 
%highlight detected weapons. Once the analysis is complete, users have the option to download the annotated video.

%Users can also access a comprehensive log of all detection events. This historical data includes detailed information 
%about each detection instance, such as the date, time, and frame, enabling users to review past incidents and 
%analyze detection patterns over time.

\section{Functional Requirements}
The main goal is to design and implement a real-time weapon detection system capable of 
analyzing surveillance footage and triggering immediate alerts. A prototype showcasing this functionality was developed. 
However, during testing and demonstrations, limitations became evident. Sometimes video streams wouldn't load consistently, 
and alerts were slow to generate. Feedback from security personnel emphasized the need for a more user-friendly 
interface, allowing for quick navigation between cameras and detailed information about detections.

These critical insights guided the development of the core functionalities outlined below:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Video Stream Handling
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The system shall accept video feeds from various sources, continuously monitoring the video streams 
    and analyze frames for weapon detection;
    \end{itemize}
    \item Detection and Alert Mechanism
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The system shall generate real-time alerts upon detecting a weapon;
    \item The system shall classify and log each detection event, including time, location, and type of weapon detected;
    \end{itemize}
    \item Video Upload for Detection
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The system shall allow users to upload pre-recorded video files (.mp4) for weapon detection analysis;
    \end{itemize}
    \item Easy Navigation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The interface shall allow users to navigate easily between different video feeds and alert logs;
    \end{itemize}
    \item User-Friendly Interface
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The system shall offer a user-friendly interface with a dashboard displaying all active video streams;
    \end{itemize}
    \item Detection History
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The system shall store video footage and detection logs securely;
    \item The system shall allow authorized personnel to access and retrieve stored video footage and 
    logs for review and analysis;
    \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

\section{High Level Architecture}
Figure \ref{fig:architecture-proposal} illustrates the architecture for the proposed system to 
automatically detect weapons. 

\begin{figure}[ht]

\end{figure}

% The Video Input (Real-Time Video) [1] consisting of \ac{cctv} cameras strategically installed across various locations, serves as the primary source of video data. These cameras are engineered to capture and transmit real-time video footage, which is then relayed frame by frame to the system for subsequent processing.

The module Video Input (Real-Time Video) [1] aims to feed the system with real-time video using the various \ac{cctv} 
cameras that are spread across various locations.  The video is presented to the system frame by frame, and analyzed 
in the following modules.

% The Queue Management component [2] plays a key role in regulating the incoming data flow. It is specifically tasked with receiving video frames from the \ac{cctv} cameras and systematically queuing them for processing. This component is crucial for several reasons:
The Queue Management component [2] deals with incoming data from previous module, and redeals with incoming data 
from previous module, and regulates the sequence flow. This is a management task, from the balance of received frames 
and sending to futher analysis. Therefore, the following items enumerates the tasks that are associated to this module:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Load Balancing: manages the influx of video frames, particularly crucial during periods of high input. Without this, the backend could become overwhelmed, potentially leading to delays or processing failures;
    \item Prioritization: allows the prioritization of video frames or streams, especially those from high-risk areas;
    \item Scalability: enables efficient scaling without necessitating significant modifications to the backend processing infrastructure.
\end{itemize}

The backend [3] serves as the system's "central processing unit". It is composed by a set of submodules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Object Detection Model [3.1]: designed to identify objects of interest, primarily focusing on potentially dangerous items like firearms and knives. It operates with a pre-trained model that was trained on a dataset, which has been finely tuned to pinpoint threats with precision.
    \item Alerting Service [3.2]: upon detection of a hazardous object, it promptly generates notifications/alerts. These alerts are then swiftly relayed to the frontend, thereby enabling law enforcement officials to receive real-time updates and respond accordingly.
\end{itemize}

The database [4] stores the critical data gererated by the system, like que video metadata, logs of detected objects, 
model-related data, and other information that supports the system.

Finally, the Frontend [5] enables the interface between system and end users (such as law enforcement officers). Tasks like the uploading of video files for analysis can be performed throw  this interface. Moreover, it serves as a dynamic platform for receiving timely updates and alerts regarding any detected objects, thereby streamlining the communication process and enhancing the efficiency of law enforcement responses.

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}

        \item Data Protection: the system must include
        secure data transmission and storage using encryption methods to prevent unauthorized access;
        \item Access Control: strict access control mechanisms should be implemented to restrict system usage to 
        authorized personnel only;
    \end{itemize}
    \item Usability
    \begin{itemize}
        \item User Interface: the system must provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for 
        operators, including visual indicators for detected threats and straightforward navigation between 
        video feeds;
    \end{itemize}
    \item Performance Monitoring
        \begin{itemize}
        \item The system shall continuously monitor its performance, including latency and throughput metrics,
        and provide administrators with tools to analyze and optimize system performance;
        \item The system shall generate reports on detection accuracy and system performance for regular review.
        \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
